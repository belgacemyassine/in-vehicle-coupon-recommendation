Stage 3 - Modeling and Evaluation
The focus of this stage was on training machine learning models using the processed data and evaluating their performance. Seven different preprocessing techniques were applied to the dataset, and five different models were tested: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost. The objective was to identify not only the best-performing model but also the most effective preprocessing approach, recognizing the experimental nature of data science.

Key Actions:

Preprocessed Data
Split Data into Training and Testing Sets
Applied Feature Engineering
Conducted Model Testing
Tuned Hyperparameters and Selected Features
Chose the Best Model
Evaluated Feature Impact on Model Output using the SHAP Library
