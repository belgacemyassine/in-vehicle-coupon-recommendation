Stage 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis
During Stage 1, I concentrated on exploring the data to derive insights from a statistical perspective.

Key Actions:

Conducted Descriptive Analysis
Performed Univariate Analysis
Performed Multivariate Analysis
Generated Business Insights and Recommendations
Stage 2 - Data Preprocessing
In Stage 2, I prepared the data for modeling by applying various preprocessing techniques.

Key Actions:

Handled Missing Values
Removed Duplicated Data
Addressed Outliers
Conducted Feature Transformation
Encoded Features
Managed Class Imbalance
Selected and Extracted Features
Stage 3 - Modeling and Evaluation
Stage 3 focused on training machine learning models with the processed data and evaluating their performance. I applied seven different preprocessing techniques to the dataset and tested five different models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost. The objective was not only to identify the best-performing model but also to determine the most effective preprocessing approach, as data science involves extensive experimentation.

Key Actions:

Preprocessed Data
Split Data into Training and Testing Sets
Applied Feature Engineering
Conducted Model Testing
Tuned Hyperparameters and Selected Features
Chose the Best Model
Evaluated Feature Impact on Model Output using SHAP Library
